h1. Textmate Bundle for Taskpaper

This is an upgrade of the "tasks-tmbundle":http://henrik.nyh.se/2007/08/tasks-bundle.

The goal is to keep the same functionality that the original bundle had but create files that are actually compatible with Taskpaper.

This bundle marks items as done using the standard Taskpaper format (adding @done to the end of the line).

h3. Bundle Features:

* Color highlighting for headers, tags, pending and done tasks.
* Toggle tasks as done or not-done with Command-D
* Add new tasks by pressing Enter

h3. TODO:

* Insert the cursor back in place in the line when Toggle Completed is executed.

h2. Installation

<pre>
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles/
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles
git clone git://github.com/jessmartin/taskpaper-tmbundle.git Taskpaper.tmbundle
</pre>

* In TextMate: From your drop down menu, select Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Reload Bundles.
